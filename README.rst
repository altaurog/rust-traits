Rust Traits
============

This is a Rust port of `UPenn CS194 Homework 5`_, which explores
Haskell typeclasses.

Conclusions
-----------
* Rust traits work just like Haskell typeclasses.  They can even be
  implemented for function and closure types.
* Rust is much more verbose, not nearly as elegant as Haskell.
* Rust makes you do the memory management.
